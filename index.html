            <h1>The Spirit of the White Mountains</h1>
            <p>There's a story these mountains tell that no guidebook can capture. It's written in granite and whispered by wind through the pines—a tale of how landscape shapes the human heart, how seasons teach resilience, and how a place can hold memory like water holds light.</p>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>These mountains have been watching for a long time. The Abenaki knew them first, gave them names that still echo in our rivers and ridges. Then came farmers who learned to coax life from thin soil and loggers who understood the language of the pines. Settlers built stone walls that still wander through the woods, marking boundaries that matter less now than the stories they hold.</p>
                    <p>Walk these trails long enough and you'll feel it—something the tourists miss in their hurry to summit and descend. It's there in the morning fog that pools in the valleys, in the particular silence after the first snow. The mountains have a way of speaking to those willing to listen, in something older than words, something that bypasses the busy mind and goes straight to the soul.</p>
                    <p>We're just gathering stories here—the kind that matter because they're true. Stories about people who stayed when others left, about quiet acts of courage that never made the papers, about a stubborn hope that returns every spring no matter how brutal the winter.</p>
                    <p>The mountains are calling. They've been calling all along. Maybe it's time to answer.</p>

                    <h3>Memory in Stone</h3>
                    <p>History lives in the cellar holes you stumble across in the woods, in the stone walls that run nowhere now but once meant everything to the families who built them. The Abenaki walked these trails before there were trails, knew these waters before they had English names. Listen closely and you can still hear all of it—the old voices layered like sediment, each one adding depth to the song.</p>

                    <h3>The Strength of Staying</h3>
                    <p>There's a particular kind of toughness that comes from living where winter means relentless cold, where spring arrives late and leaves early, where you plan around nature's schedule instead of your own. Watch a farmer checking the frost on an April morning or neighbors showing up without being asked when someone's barn needs a new roof. You're seeing a quiet refusal to let hardship have the final word.</p>

                    <h3>What the Forest Knows</h3>
                    <p>Thoreau spent time in these woods because books could only teach him so much. Out here, the lessons come differently. A white pine growing sideways on an exposed ridge teaches persistence better than any sermon. The river that roars in April and whispers in September understands patience in a way we're still learning. Nature offers these truths to anyone humble enough to receive them.</p>

                <h2>An Appeal to Something Higher</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="flag-content">
                <p>The pine tree on that old revolutionary flag represented something wilder and more essential than timber or defiance—the idea that some principles run deeper than any human law, that certain truths don't require a king's signature to be valid, that justice sometimes needs to be sought beyond the courts that claim to dispense it.</p>
                <p>That same spirit lives in these hills today. You'll see it in farmers planting crops despite knowing September's first frost is always a gamble, in communities that refuse to disappear even after the mill closes and the young people leave. It's a faith in something more fundamental than government programs or economic forecasts: the stubborn persistence of life itself, the green shoots that push through the ashes after fire.</p>
                <p>When they raised that flag with its solitary pine and its audacious claim—"An Appeal to Heaven"—they were saying that some things matter more than power, more than comfort, more than getting along. They were willing to stake everything on principles that couldn't be proven, only lived. Walk these mountains long enough and you'll understand why.</p>
